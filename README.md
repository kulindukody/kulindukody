# 👾 Red Team | Malware Development | Adversary Tradecraft

I’m a **Red Team Engineer & Malware Developer** focused on building, breaking, and understanding offensive security from the attacker’s perspective.

My work revolves around:
- Custom malware & loaders  
- Adversary simulation and red team tooling  
- Windows & Active Directory exploitation  
- Evasion, OPSEC, and tradecraft refinement  

I don’t just use tools — I **build them, modify them, and break detections**.
